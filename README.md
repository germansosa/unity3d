# Unity3D in Docker
This is [Unity3D for Linux](http://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/08/26/unity-comes-to-linux-experimental-build-now-available/) run with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

_TL;DR if this is your first time running this, simply run_

    xhost +
    make all

Otherwise, the steps can be run individually.

## Download

Download the latest Unity3D Linux build from the [release notes](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/unity-on-linux-release-notes-and-known-issues.350256/#post-2429209) with

    make download

## Build

Build the Docker image with

    make build

## Run

Run Unity3D with Docker with

    make run

## Pulseaudio

Before running the docker, run `paprefs` and enable 'Network Server > Enable Network Access to other devices' to be able to get pulseaudio to work. And run this (or put in ~/.bashrc):

    export PULSE_SERVER=$(pax11publish | sed 's/.*tcp:/tcp:/g;s/ .*//g' | head -n1)

# Importing assets

Create an asset directory in `gamedev`'s home directory, if you haven't already done so:

    mkdir gamedevhome/assets

Copy the downloaded asset there:

    cp ~/Downloads/LeapMotion_CoreAsset_Orion_Beta_4.0.1.unitypackage gamedevhome/assets

Now, in Unity3D, import the asset from `/home/gamedev/assets`
